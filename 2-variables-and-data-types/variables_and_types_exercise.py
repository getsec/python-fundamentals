# Exercise 1: Create and Print Variables

# Task: Create three variables:
# 1. `client_name`: A string holding your client's name (e.g., "Global Investments").
# 2. `portfolio_size`: An integer representing the number of assets in their portfolio (e.g., 150).
# 3. `current_yield`: A float representing the current yield of a bond (e.g., 0.035).

# After creating each variable, print its value and its data type using the `type()` function.
# Example:
# print("Variable Name:", variable_name)
# print("Type of variable_name is:", type(variable_name))
# print("-" * 20) # Separator
