# Exercise 1: Simple Greeting Function

# Task: Define a function called `greet_treasury_analyst` that takes no arguments
# and prints "Hello, Treasury Analyst! Welcome to your Python toolkit."
# Call the function after defining it.

# Exercise 2: Calculate Future Value Function

# Task: Define a function called `calculate_bond_future_value` that takes three arguments:
# `present_value`, `annual_rate`, and `years`.
# The function should calculate the future value using the formula:
# `future_value = present_value * (1 + annual_rate) ** years`
# The function should `return` the calculated `future_value`.
# Call the function with `present_value = 5000`, `annual_rate = 0.04`, `years = 5`
# and print the returned value, formatted to two decimal places.

# Exercise 3: Create Trade Record Function

# Task: Define a function called `create_simple_trade_record` that takes:
# `trade_id` (string), `ticker` (string), `quantity` (integer), `price` (float).
# The function should create and `return` a dictionary with these keys and values:
# `{"id": trade_id, "stock_ticker": ticker, "amount": quantity, "execution_price": price}`
# Call the function with sample data (e.g., "TRD001", "GOOGL", 10, 1500.75) and print the returned dictionary.
