# Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operations

# Task: Perform the following arithmetic operations and store the results in new variables.
# 1. `total_assets`: Add `cash_on_hand` (50000) and `investment` (35000).
# 2. `net_profit`: Subtract `expenses` (12000) from `revenue` (25000).
# 3. `quarterly_growth`: Multiply `initial_value` (100000) by `growth_factor` (1.02).
# 4. `average_return`: Divide `total_return` (1500) by `num_investments` (10).
# 5. `remainder_funds`: Find the remainder when `total_budget` (75000) is divided by `project_cost` (20000).

# Print each result.
