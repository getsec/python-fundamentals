# Exercise 1: Simple if/else Statement

# Task: Write an if/else statement to check if a `current_balance` is below a `minimum_threshold`.
# - `current_balance`: 12000
# - `minimum_threshold`: 10000
# If `current_balance` is less than `minimum_threshold`, print "Balance is below threshold. Fund immediately!".
# Otherwise, print "Balance is healthy.".

# Exercise 2: if/elif/else Statement

# Task: Categorize a `transaction_amount` based on its value.
# - `transaction_amount`: 7500
# - If `transaction_amount` is greater than 10000, print "Large Transaction".
# - Else if `transaction_amount` is greater than 5000, print "Medium Transaction".
# - Else, print "Small Transaction".
