# 1. Introduction to Python and Setup

Welcome to Python!

## What is Python?

Python is a popular, easy-to-learn programming language. It's known for its clean and readable syntax. Think of it as a set of instructions you give to the computer to perform tasks.

## Why Python for Data Analysis and Treasury?

- **Powerful Libraries:** Python has amazing free tools (called libraries) like `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `SciPy` that are perfect for handling large datasets, performing complex calculations, and statistical analysis.
- **Automation:** You can automate repetitive tasks, like downloading reports, cleaning data, and generating summaries, saving you a lot of time.
- **Versatility:** Beyond data, you can use it to build applications, create models, and integrate with other systems.

## Your First Python Program

A "Hello, World!" program is a tradition for starting any new language. It's a simple program that just prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. This confirms that your setup is working correctly.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to this directory (`01_introduction_and_setup`).
4.  Run the script by typing:

    ```bash
    python hello_world.py
    ```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed as the output.
