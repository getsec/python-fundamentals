# Exercise 1: `for` Loop for Transaction Processing

# Task: Iterate through the `transaction_amounts` list and calculate the `total_revenue`.
# - `transaction_amounts`: `[150.25, 200.00, 75.50, 300.00]`
# - Initialize `total_revenue` to 0.0.
# - Use a `for` loop to add each `amount` in `transaction_amounts` to `total_revenue`.
# - Print the `total_revenue` at the end, formatted to two decimal places.

# Exercise 2: `while` Loop for Capital Growth

# Task: Simulate capital growth until a `target_capital` is reached.
# - `initial_capital`: 1000
# - `target_capital`: 1500
# - `annual_interest_rate`: 0.05 (5%)
# - Initialize `years` to 0.
# - Use a `while` loop to repeatedly apply the interest rate to `initial_capital` and increment `years`
#   until `initial_capital` is greater than or equal to `target_capital`.
# - Inside the loop, print the capital at the end of each year, formatted to two decimal places.
# - After the loop, print the total number of `years` it took to reach the target.
